Introduction to HTML: You will be creating your first HTML page!

1. Create a folder structure off your root as follows: "dev/exercises/html"

2. Create a file named "mysite.html"

3. Open mysite.html in a text editor. At the top of the file include the following:

  <!DOCTYPE html>

4. Underneath that, include an opening and closing "html" tag like this:

  <html></html>

5. Inside the html tag you just created include an opening and closing "head" tag like this:

  <head></head>

6. After the head tag, include a "body" tag like this:

  <body></body>

7. Inside the body tag, include an h1 tag with the folowing: <h1>Here are some lists</h1>

8. After your name header, include an unordered list by using the this tag: <ul></ul>

9. Inside the ul tag we now want to include list items by nesting the following:

  <ul>Learn HTML</ul>
  <ul>Learn CSS</ul>
  <ul>Learn Javascript</ul>

10. Copy the unordered list you just made and paste it directly after the original list. 
    Change the <ul> tags to <ol>. How does this list differ from the <ul> ?

11. After the lists that you just created include a horizontal rule: <hr>

12. After the <hr> include a sub header as such: <h3>Here is some additional text</h3>

13. After the h3 tag you just created, include the following comment:

  <!-- here are some different text options in this section -->

14. Include the following in a paragraph tag as such:

  <p>
    I am learning my first HTML! First, we will learn Hypertext Markup Language, or HTML, then
    we will learn Cascading Style Sheets, or CSS for short. Then we will spend a fair amount of
    time learning Javascript. These three all make up Front-End programming.
  </p>

15. Inside the paragraph you just created, emphasize the words "HTML" and "CSS" by embedding those
    in the <b> and <i> tags respectively.

16. Include another <hr> tag after your paragraph

17. After the <hr> include another sub header as such: <h3>Here are some awesome links</h3>

18. <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a> <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org">MDN Web Docs</a> <a href="https://stackoverflow.com">Stack Overflow</a>
