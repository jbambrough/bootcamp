Introduction to HTML: You will be creating your first HTML page!

1. Create a folder structure off your root as follows: "dev/exercises/html"

2. Create a file named "html-intro.html"

3. Open mysite.html in a text editor. At the top of the file include the following:

  <!DOCTYPE html>

4. Underneath that, include an opening and closing "html" tag like this:

  <html></html>

5. Inside the html tag you just created include an opening and closing "head" and "title" tags like this:

  <head>
    <title>HTML Basics</title>
  </head>

6. After the head tag, include a "body" tag like this:

  <body></body>

7. Inside the body tag, include an h1 tag with the folowing: <h1>Here are our Front-End topics</h1>

8. After your name header, include an unordered list by using the this tag: <ul></ul>

9. Inside the ul tag we now want to include list items by nesting the following:

  <ul>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</ul>
  <ul>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</ul>
  <ul>Javascript</ul>

10. Copy the unordered list you just made and paste it directly after the original list. 
    Change the <ul> tags to <ol>. How does this list differ from the <ul> ?

11. After the lists that you just created include a horizontal rule: <hr>

12. After the <hr> include a sub header as such: <h3>Here is some additional text</h3>

13. After the h3 tag you just created, include the following comment:

  <!-- here are some different text options in this section -->

14. Include the following in a paragraph tag as such:

  <p>
    I am learning my first HTML! First, we will learn Hypertext Markup Language, or HTML, then
    we will learn Cascading Style Sheets, or CSS for short. Then we will spend a fair amount of
    time learning Javascript. These three all make up Front-End programming.
  </p>

15. Inside the paragraph you just created, emphasize the words "HTML" and "CSS" by embedding those
    in the <b> and <i> tags respectively.

16. Include another <hr> tag after your paragraph

17. After the <hr> include another sub header as such: <h3>Here are some awesome links</h3>

18. <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a> &#9670; 
    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org">MDN Web Docs</a> &#9670; 
    <a href="https://stackoverflow.com">Stack Overflow</a>

19. Inside the Google link opening <a> tag, include the following attribute:

    target="_blank"

    NOTE: The name/value pairs embeded inside a tag are called "Attributes". They have
          a special purpose and are included as part of the HTML standards

20. Download an image from the internet, store it in the same folder as this .html file

21. Add another <hr> tag

21. Include this h3 tag: <h3>Here is a cool picture</h3>

22. Include an image tag like so based on the name of the image you downloaded:

    <img src="<your picture name>">

23. Add the width attribute and change the values. Save after each change and note what happens to the image:

    width="100%"
    width="25%"
    width="200px"

24. Add the height attribute:

    height="150px"

25. Remove both the width and height attributes to preserve the aspect ratio of the picture

26. Add another <hr> tag

27. Include this h3 tag: <h3>Fun with containers</h3>

28. Add this text within a div tag like so (you can include any text you like inside the div):

    <div>
      Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Mauris vestibulum mi metus, pharetra cursus orci 
      aliquam vel. Ut laoreet ultrices libero eu cursus. Aliquam congue, risus id mattis condimentum, urna libero 
      malesuada mi, vel molestie erat erat sed leo. Mauris dictum urna non viverra facilisis. Donec scelerisque cursus 
      metus eget faucibus. Nulla vitae purus quam. Suspendisse tempor interdum sem quis tempor. Nulla vel metus non 
      orci luctus iaculis id at orci.
    </div>
